//! WoAB (Widgets on Actors Bridge) is a GUI microframework for combining the widgets toolkit
//! [GTK](https://gtk-rs.org/) with the actors framework [Actix](https://actix.rs/). It helps with:
//!
//! * Running the actors inside the GTK thread, allowing message handlers to interact with the
//!   widgets directly.
//! * Routing GTK signals through the asynchronous runtime, so that the code handling them can
//!   proceed naturally to interact with the actors.
//! * Mapping widgets and signals from [Glade](https://glade.gnome.org/) XML files to user types.
//!
//! To use WoAB one would typically create a factories struct using
//! [`woab::Factories`](derive.Factories.html) and use it dissect the Glade XML file(s). Each field
//! of the factories struct will be a [`woab::BuilderFactory`](BuilderFactory) that can:
//!
//! * Create a widgets struct using [`woab::WidgetsFromBuilder`](derive.WidgetsFromBuilder.html).
//! * Route the signals defined in the builder to Actix handlers using [`woab::Signal`](Signal)
//!   messages.
//! * In the Actix handler, match on the signal name (`msg.name()`) and use
//!   [`woab::params!`](crate::params!) to extract the signal parameters.
//!
//! The factories can then be used to generate the GTK widgets and either connect them to a new
//! actor which will receive the signals defined in the Glade GTK or connect them to an existing
//! actor and tag the signals (so that multiple instances can be added - e.g. with `GtkListBox` -
//! and the signal handler can know from which one the event came). The actors receive the signals
//! as Actix messages, and the `Handler` returns the propagation decision (if the signal requires
//! it)
//!
//! To remove widget-bound actors at runtime, see [`woab::Remove`](Remove).
//!
//! To synchronize the widgets' data with a model (or any old Rust values), see
//! [`woab::PropSync`](crate::PropSync).
//!
//! Do not run the Actix system or GTK manually - use [`woab::main`](crate::main) instead.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use actix::prelude::*;
//! use gtk4::prelude::*;
//! 
//! struct MyActor {
//!     widgets: MyWidgets,
//! }
//! 
//! impl Actor for MyActor {
//!     type Context = Context<Self>;

//! // object IDs.

//!     window: gtk4::ApplicationWindow,

//! impl Handler<woab::Signal> for MyActor {

//! # Pitfalls
//!
//! * When starting Actix actors from outside Tokio/Actix, [`woab::block_on`](block_on) must be
//!   used. This is a limitation of Actix that needs to be respected.
//! * If an actor is created inside a `gtk4::Application::connect_activate`, its `started` method
//!   will run **after** the `activate` signal is done. This can be a problem for methods like
//!   `set_application` that can segfault if they are called outside the `activate` signal. A
//!   solution could be to either do the startup inside `connect_activate` or use
//!   [`woab::route_signal`](crate::route_signal) to route the application's `activate` signal
//!   to the actor and do the startup in the actor's signal handler.
