//! WoAB (Widgets on Actors Bridge) is a GUI microframework for combining the widgets toolkit
//! [GTK](https://gtk-rs.org/) with the actors framework [Actix](https://actix.rs/). It helps with:
//!
//! * Running the actors inside the GTK thread, allowing message handlers to interact with the
//!   widgets directly.
//! * Routing GTK signals through the asynchronous runtime, so that the code handling them can
//!   proceed naturally to interact with the actors.
//! * Mapping widgets and signals from [Glade](https://glade.gnome.org/) XML files to user types.
//!
//! To use WoAB one would typically create a factories struct using
//! [`woab::Factories`](derive.Factories.html) and use it dissect the Glade XML file(s). Each field
//! of the factories struct will be a [`woab::BuilderFactory`](BuilderFactory) that can:
//!
//! * Create a widgets struct using [`woab::WidgetsFromBuilder`](derive.WidgetsFromBuilder.html).
//! * Route the signals defined in the builder to Actix handlers using [`woab::Signal`](Signal)
//!   messages.
//! * In the Actix handler, match on the signal name (`msg.name()`) and use
//!   [`woab::params!`](crate::params!) to extract the signal parameters.
//!
//! The factories can then be used to generate the GTK widgets and either connect them to a new
//! actor which will receive the signals defined in the Glade GTK or connect them to an existing
//! actor and tag the signals (so that multiple instances can be added - e.g. with `GtkListBox` -
//! and the signal handler can know from which one the event came). The actors receive the signals
//! as Actix messages, and the `Handler` returns the inhibitness decision (if the signal requires
//! it)
//!
//! To remove widget-bound actors at runtime, see [`woab::Remove`](Remove).
//!
//! After initializing GTK and before starting the main loop,
//! [`woab::run_actix_inside_gtk_event_loop`](run_actix_inside_gtk_event_loop) **must** be called.
//! **Do not run the Actix system manually!**
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use actix::prelude::*;
//! use gtk::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[derive(woab::Factories)]
//! struct Factories {
//!     // The field name must be the ID from the builder XML file:
//!     main_window: woab::BuilderFactory,
//!     // Possibly other things from the builder XML file that need to be created during the program.
//! }
//!
//! struct AppActor {
//!     widgets: AppWidgets,
//!     factories: std::rc::Rc<Factories>, // for creating more things from inside the actor.
//!     // More actor data
//! }
//!
//! impl actix::Actor for AppActor {
//!     type Context = actix::Context<Self>;
//! }
//!
//! #[derive(woab::WidgetsFromBuilder)]
//! struct AppWidgets {
//!     main_window: gtk::ApplicationWindow, // needed for making the window visible
//!     // Other widgets inside the window to interact with.
//! }
//!
//! impl actix::Handler<woab::Signal> for AppActor {
//!     type Result = woab::SignalResult;
//!
//!     fn handle(&mut self, msg: woab::Signal, ctx: &mut <Self as actix::Actor>::Context) -> Self::Result {
//!         Ok(match msg.name() {
//!             // These are custom signals defined in Glade's "Signals" tab.
//!             "sig1" => {
//!                 // Behavior for sig1.
//!                 None // GTK does not expect sig1 to return anything
//!             },
//!             "sig2" => {
//!                 let woab::params!(text_buffer: gtk::TextBuffer, _) = msg.params()?;
//!                 // Behavior for sig2 that uses the signal parameters.
//!                 Some(gtk::Inhibit(false)) // GTK expects sig2 to return its inhibitness decision
//!             },
//!             _ => msg.cant_handle()?,
//!         })
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! #    fn read_builder_xml() -> std::io::BufReader<std::fs::File> {
//! #        unreachable!()
//! #    }
//!     let factories = std::rc::Rc::new(Factories::read(read_builder_xml())?);
//!     gtk::init()?;
//!     woab::run_actix_inside_gtk_event_loop()?; // <===== IMPORTANT!!!
//!
//!     factories.main_window.instantiate().connect_with(|bld| {
//!         let widgets: AppWidgets = bld.widgets().unwrap();
//!         widgets.main_window.show_all(); // Could also be done inside the actor
//!         AppActor {
//!             widgets,
//!             factories: factories,
//!         }.start()
//!     });
//!
//!     gtk::main();
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Pitfalls
//!
//! * When you start Actix actors from outside Tokio/Actix, you must use
//!   [`woab::block_on`](block_on). This is a limitation of Actix that we need to respect.
//! * Some GTK actions (like removing a widget) can fire signals synchronously. If these signals
//!   are registered as builder signals, WoAB will not be able to route them and panic because it
//!   will happen while the Actix runtime is occupied. To work around this, use
//!   [`woab::schedule_outside`](schedule_outside).
